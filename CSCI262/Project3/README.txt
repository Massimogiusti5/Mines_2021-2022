1) collaborators: none

2) A challenge I had with this project was figuring out where to start. 
   When initally looking at the source code as well as the course page,
   I was very confused as to what the source code wanted me to do. At first
   I was thinking about this problem top-down, but by changing my design 
   process to bottom up made me better understand the source code as well
   as the workings of the eventual game. For example, by initially coding up 
   the prompts and all the helper functions, I eventually got to solving the 
   problem one step at a time and it was straightforward from there.

3) What I liked about this assignment was the use of multiple data structures 
   for optimized execution. For example, I had initially drafted my solution to use
   vectors, but I saw that vectors were ineffective due to the amount of insertion/deletion 
   and comparisons the game had to do. I then integrated a mix of vectors, sets and maps to
   improve my solution, and that was the fun part of the project. 

4) I spent about 4 and a half hours on this assignment.

5) no EC features
