1. I worked on this lab myself

2. The algorithms I chose to develop were egyptian multiplication and the Sieve of Eratosthenes

- for egyptian multiplication, what I wrote was pretty straightforward and mirrors the algorithm on paper. 
  However, for finding prime numbers, I had to go a little off script for the solution since removing elements 
  from a vector is less trivial with iterators in the context of the algorithm.
