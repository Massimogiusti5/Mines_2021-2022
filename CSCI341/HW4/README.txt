CSCI 341 HW4 - Hash Code of a String

Collaborators: none*

* I tried getting help at the beginning because I didn't really understand where to begin. 
  However, all the people I talked to took this course with MIPS, and thus couldn't really 
  help (especially with coding). Therefore, this solution is entirely my own

2. I faced many challenged with this project. First of all, I faced many design issues. When I started,
   I knew how to get the hash code of a string in c++, so I had issues coming up with how I wanted my assembly
   program to work. I surmounted this by forgetting about c++ and adopting a bottom up design for my solution.
   I started by coding up small operations like getting the input string, getting a pointer to that string,
   copying the string into another memory address and then also operating on the string. These small steps 
   helped me realize the solution to the problem, and it was pretty smooth from there. The only other issue was 
   translating what I wanted to do to assembly. After drawing it out and thinking about it, I didn't have much issue.


3. What I liked about this assignment was how it took a 5 line solution in c++ and turned it into 
   50 lines of code. This really challenged me to think about exactly how I wanted to design my program.
   For example, I really struggled with finding a way to iterate through the string, but as I changed my 
   perspective on how the solution should be designed, it became more clear to me. I also like how involved
   the debugging process was. I liked how I could see exactly what was happening at every step.

4. I spent a good amount of time on this project, I estimate close to 5 hours. 2 were spent conceptualizing,
   the remaining 3 were spend coding, then I spend like another half hour optimizing and editing my code

5. I did not add any features for extra credit.
